    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team)

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log(players, team)

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    team[3] = "Poppy"
    console.log("team2",players, team2)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    console.log("team3",players, team3)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    team4[3]= "heeee hawww"
    console.log("team4",players, team4)
    
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team5[3] = "cool"
    console.log("team5",players, team5)


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    console.log(person)

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.number = 99
    console.log(person)
    delete captain.number

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99})
    console.log(person, captain2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}
    console.log(cap3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
